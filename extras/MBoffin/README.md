Hehehe! I bet you're looking for that gift card. Well you can have it back, but
only if you can solve my puzzle. The answer will tell you where to look.

You can find a big, scrambled mess of characters at this link: [bit.ly/scrambled-mess](https://bit.ly/scrambled-mess).

I hid several duplicate characters in there. There are all kinds of characters,
but you need to find ONLY the capital letters (A-Z) and the dashes (-) that are
duplicated. For example, out of this string:
```
7*(()HsdiKK%322sbu--1^*NsK##-DHHdMm&&--vhso55eeneskTT@#1k
```
The double characters are:
```
(K2-#H&-5eT
```
But you only care about these ones:
```
K-H-T
```

With love and a dash of spite,

You solved my puzzle! I bet you thought the gift card would be hidden there.
(You can't tell, but I'm smirking at you.)

Well, you're not quite done yet. Since you've already guessed that I was
inspired by Advent of Code, you should have guessed that there would be two
parts to this!

I _actually_ hid the gift card in one of those cute little houses on the
Christmas tree (my compliments to the decorator, by the way). If you find only
the duplicate _numerals_, you'll see which house it's hidden in. For example,
out of the string above:
```
7*(()HsdiKK%322sbu--1^*NsK##-DHHdMm&&--vhso55eeneskTT@#1k
```
The only duplicate numerals are:
```
25
```
So you would need to look in house #25. But of course I didn't hide it there â€“
that would be too obvious!

Anyway, I suppose that if you can solve both parts of this puzzle, then you
deserve the gift card.

Cheers,  
Your moderately-impressed-but-still-rather-naughty friend, Mr. Mischievous Elf
