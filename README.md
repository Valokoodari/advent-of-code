# Advent of Code Solutions
This repository contains (almost) all of my solutions to Advent of Code through the years.

The first year I participated in Advent of code was 2017 but I only got a couple of days back then.
In 2018 I was able to get a bit further but 2019 was the first year I actually got all the way to
the end (and got points on the global leaderboard). Back then I used C++ but in 2020 I changed
primarily to Python to make writing the code faster as I hadn't had enough practice during the year.

## Python template
In 2021 I decided that I finally need to start building myself a framework to help read the input,
run the example cases as tests, measure the execution time, and most importantly :sparkles: look
pretty :sparkles:.
