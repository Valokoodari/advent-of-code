# Advent of Code 2019

I will share all of my (unoptimized) C++ and Python solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) here.  
My goal is to write readable code in C++ as I have already used it a lot in competitions.  
But at the same time I want to learn Python and I'm unable to make any decisions, so...
