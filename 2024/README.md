# Advent of Code 2024

This year I'll be solving the puzzles of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) with Python 3.13 but I will
unfortunately not be able to compete this year due to work.

## How I solved it?

### Day 14, Part 2
Just printed the whole map and seconds elapsed in console and noticed that the robots bunch up on `t â‰¡ 2 mod 101` and
then changed the code to only show those until I saw the tree at `6668 = (2 + 66 * 101)` (your values may differ).
The solution included in the code just finds the first `t` where all of the robots are at an unique location as it
seems to always give the correct answer.

### Day 16
**Part 1:** Had dijkstra ready to go as just 9 hours earlier I had realized that I haven't seen it yet this year. Even
messaged a friend that maybe day 16 is going to finally require finding the shortest path. **Part 2:** Overthinking
killed it :'c (Although that overthinked version was a lot faster than the smaller one here)

### Day 17
The first attempt was to start the brute force option but it didn't take long to realize that the answer was somewhere
in the trillions and bruting would take years even with the correct range. It took quite a while before I realized that
the solution can be searched in octal digit by digit (nice? visualization underneath).
```python
# Minimum value for A to get right length:  35_184_372_088_832
# Maximum value for A to get right lenght: 281_474_976_710_655

# [2,4]   v
# [0,1,2] |       v
# [0,4,5] |       0   v
# [0,1]   |       |   0     v
# [2,6]   |       |   5 v   |
# [5,7]   |       |   | 6 v |
# [2,7]   |       |   | | 5 |   v
# [2,7]   |       |   | | | |   2   v
ns = [7,0,2,6,4,2,0,3,5,6,5,1,4,2,7,2]
```

### Day 18
**Part 1:** Dijkstra. **Part 2:** Binary search because I didn't create the grid at first and `if (x,y) in ms` is slow.
