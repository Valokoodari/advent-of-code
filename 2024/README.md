# Advent of Code 2024

This year I'll be solving the puzzles of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) with Python 3.13 but I will
unfortunately not be able to compete this year due to work.

## How I solved it?

### Day 14, Part 2
Just printed the whole map and seconds elapsed in console and noticed that the robots bunch up on `t â‰¡ 2 mod 101` and
then changed the code to only show those until I saw the tree at `6668 = (2 + 66 * 101)` (your values may differ).
The solution included in the code just finds the first `t` where all of the robots are at an unique location as it
seems to always give the correct answer.

### Day 16
**Part 1:** Had dijkstra ready to go as just 9 hours earlier I had realized that I haven't seen it yet this year. Even
messaged a friend that maybe day 16 is going to finally require finding the shortest path. **Part 2:** Overthinking
killed it :'c (Although that overthinked version was a lot faster than the smaller one here)
